# Project Title : Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning

# Project Overview

Brain tumors are one of the most common types of cancer and they can have serious implications for patient health and wellbeing. The traditional diagnostic methods for brain tumors, such as MRI, have limitations and may not always be accurate in identifying the presence of a tumor or its location. This can result in delays in treatment and a lower likelihood of successful outcomes for patients.

The problem statement for this project is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various neural network models in predicting the presence of brain tumors using MRI images. The primary goal of this project is to explore the potential of deep learning techniques in improving the accuracy of brain tumor diagnosis and to identify the most efficient neural network model for this purpose.
